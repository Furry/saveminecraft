                        Minecraft's new update is adding a chat reporting system that will could ruin Minecraft multiplayer forever, as not only does the reporting system allow for false reports and exploits, but even legitimate use could be an invasion of privacy. Minecraft moderation has been on a server to server basis since the game's inception and has allowed for the game to live up to the inspiring quote, "No one can tell you what you can or cannot do, with no rules to follow, this adventure, it's up to you." The multiplayer scene was arguably what built Minecraft into the world's most popular game, and the decentralization and independence it gave players was by far the most important element of that. Minecraft has always felt private, where every player could make a secluded world, alone or with friends. Adding the ablility to get banned from multiplayer as a whole completely ruins the very core principles of community-run and moderated servers. #saveminecraft
